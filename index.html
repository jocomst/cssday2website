          <h2>Things I saw and did</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Hike the Inca Trail
              <p>
                Getting to Machu Picchu is best via the famed Inca Trail. This
                multi-day 43-kilometer (26-mile) hike allows you to see the
                mountains, jungles, and follow the route the Incas used to take.
                It is a truly spectacular hike, but it is challenging and you
                may experience altitude sickness. There are two ways to do this
                hike: you can sign up to be part of an organized tour, or you
                can hire your own private guide. You cannot hike the trail
                independently. Tours start around 2,700 PEN for a 4-day, 3-night
                tour with a reliable, reputable company. The final leg of the
                hike can actually get a bit crowded, so if you can do a longer
                7-day hike you'll be able to beat the crowds and enjoy the
                incredible landscape before you arrive.

              Visit the Islas Flotantes de los Uros
              <p>
                The Floating Islands of the Uros may sound like an Indiana Jones
                title, but it is actually the name of the group of man-made
                islands in Lake Titicaca. The islands are home to the indigenous
                Uros people who have built their own houses, islands, and boats
                from the tortora reeds which grow along the banks of the lake.
                This is an extremely touristy site and is a bit exploited as
                such, so it's not for everyone.

            <li>
              Surf at Máncora Beach
              <p>
                Seafood, watersports, horseback riding, and relaxation are the
                order of the day at this popular beach resort. Máncora is one of
                the finest beaches in South America and its year-round sunshine
                and huge waves also make it Peru’s surfing Mecca. A private surf
                lesson costs around 80 PEN. Accommodation prices can be
                expensive from December to March, so it's best to book in
                advance.

              Step back through time at Batán Grande
              <p>
                Batán Grande, also known as the Sicán Archaeological Complex, is
                an archaeological site comprised of 50 pyramids and tombs, which
                are thought to date to 100-1000 CE. Located near Chiclayo, this
                site was once the ancient Sicán capital and has yielded many
                impressive pre-Columbian artifacts. For example, a gold Tumi
                weighing almost seven pounds was recovered from one of the royal
                tombs!

            <li>
              Discover Cusco
              <p>
                This colonial city is a major tourist destination and sits on
                Inca-built stone foundations not far from Machu Picchu. The area
                is popular with trail walkers, history lovers, and partygoers
                who come to enjoy the city's nightlife and festivals. Cusco is
                the undisputed archaeological capital of the Americas and an
                essential part of your trip to Peru. Be sure to visit Coricancha
                (15 PEN) and Sacsayhuaman (free admission) during your visit.
                For great food, head to Green Point.

              <h2>The Alpacas and the Inca culture</h2>
              <p>
                Alpacas were treasured as the most important animal for the Inca
                civilization. Their meat was consumed fresh in traditional
                preparations such as charqui and chalona; with their wool they
                made yarns and fabrics; his bones, leather, fat and excrement
                had diverse applications such as musical instruments, footwear,
                medicines and fertilizer respectively. Due to this
                consideration, they were preferred animals for religious
                sacrifices, the Incas thought that sacrificing an alpaca served
                to appease their gods.
